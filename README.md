## Vehicle Analysis

## Aim to gain insights into various aspects of vehicles attributes and trends.

## 📊 Dataset Overview:

- The Vehicles dataset provides a detailed record of vehicle telemetry and operational metrics, including GPS coordinates, engine load, battery voltage, and other performance indicators.

## Key Features of the Dataset:

- uniqueid: Unique identifier for each vehicle or unit.
- ts: Timestamp of the recorded data.
- lat, lng: GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- engineload: Current engine load percentage.
- coolant: Coolant temperature.
- internal_bat_voltage & external_bat_voltage: Battery voltage readings.
- tanklevel: Fuel tank level.
- throttle: Throttle position.
- adblue_level: Level of diesel exhaust fluid (AdBlue).
- Additional parameters: Intake manifold temperature, exhaust gas temperature, air inlet pressure, etc.

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

**EDA was conducted to extract patterns and insights:**

- Location Trends: Visualized GPS data to identify frequently visited locations or movement patterns.
- Engine Performance: Analyzed engine load, coolant temperature, and throttle for performance trends.
- Battery Insights: Examined internal and external battery voltage for abnormalities.
- Fuel Analysis: Investigated fuel tank levels and diesel exhaust fluid usage.
- Time Series Analysis: Explored variations in vehicle performance over time.

## 🚀 Key Features:

- Python Analysis: Discover the data cleaning, transformations, and visualizations in the Vehicles dataset.
- Interactive Visualizations: Explore key metrics and trends with graphical insights.

## 🧰 Tools Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 💡 Insights:
- Vehicles maintain consistent engine loads under normal conditions, but spikes indicate potential performance issues.
- Battery voltage patterns help identify maintenance needs.
- Location-based trends can inform routing or usage optimization.
- Coolant temperature trends correlate with vehicle usage intensity.
